        To install ckanext-officedocs:
        
        1. Clone this repository into the place where you normally install extensions,
           by default this will be /usr/lib/ckan/default/src/
        
        2. Activate your CKAN virtual environment, for example::
        
             . /usr/lib/ckan/default/bin/activate
        
        3. Install the ckanext-officedocs Python package into your virtual environment::
        
             cd ckanext-officedocs
             python setup.py install
        
        3. Add ``officedocs_view`` to the ``ckan.plugins`` setting in your CKAN
           config file (by default the config file is located at
           ``/etc/ckan/default/production.ini``).

        FAQ
        ------------
        Q: It doesn't work, my documents aren't previewing
        
        A: For this extension to work, the documents to be previewed must be accessible to the
        wider internet, and will only work if you use a hostname, and not just an IP address.
